# Final Documentation Goals

1. **Define the desired game mechanic or feature**.
	> Ghost car visualization for lap times, that is determined to interrupt the players new lap time, in order to "stay-alive".
2.  **Outline an objective statement for the design**
	> How competitive can a singleplayer time trail game be, when your best time can actively sabotage the player?
3.  **Detail design rationale**.
	> The experience that we are aiming for revolves around the player attempting to beat their best time in a lap, despite the odds created by their best times' attempt to sabotage the player. The experimental aspect of the design is in the rudimentary AI that controls the time visualization car; Putting a competitive spin on the classic time trial feature, that is generally considered a tool for the player to beat their personal best times.
5.  **Cite all resources, tangible, informative, and transformative**
